# ClockJS
### Super simple, minimal Chrome extension that displays the day, date, and time.

Mostly just an exploration in getting my feet wet with Chrome extensions. :clock1030:
Minimal Clock with Vanilla Javascript https://alfalahtaieb.github.io/ClockJS/

 Go to Chrome's settings page > Extensions (or just type [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)). Click *Load unpacked extension*, browse to the uncompressed folder and select it. Done!

If you ever want your old new tab page back, just disable the extension's checkbox from the [extensions page](chrome://extensions) or remove it completely.
